1. Introduction
---------------
QComicBook is a viewer for comic book archives containing
jpeg/png/xpm/gif images, which aims at convenience and simplicity.
Features include: automatic decompression, full-screen mode, two-pages
viewing, page scaling, mouse or keyboard navigation etc.

2. Requirements
---------------
QComicBook requires Qt library version 3.3.3. It *may* work with earlier
versions (from 3.x family), but it was not tested. You will also need
unzip and rar (or unrar) somewhere in your path to handle archives.

3. Installation
---------------
To compile QComicBook, you will need Qt developement package (Qt
headers, usually named -devel- in many distros). Compilation include
three steps:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install

Debian users should add "--with-Qt-lib-dir=/usr/lib" option to the
first step.

4. Bugs
-------
Please report any bugs to: yogin@linux.bydg.org. Ideas are welcome too!
