1. Introduction
---------------
QComicBook is a viewer for comic book archives containing
jpeg/png/xpm/gif images, which aims at convenience and simplicity.
Features include: automatic decompression, full-screen mode, two-pages
viewing, japanese mode, thumbnails view, page scaling, mouse or keyboard
navigation etc.

2. Requirements
---------------
QComicBook requires Qt library version >=4.3.0 and cmake.
It *may* work with earlier versions of Qt (from 4.x family), but it was not
tested. You will also need unzip, rar (or unrar), unace and tar (with gzip and
bzip2 support compiled in) somewhere in your path to handle archives. If one of
these tools is missing you can still use QComicBook, but you won't be able to
open some archives.

3. Installation
---------------
To compile QComicBook, you will need Qt4 developement packages (usually named
-devel- in many distros). Compilation includes three steps:

$ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
$ make
$ make install
(the -D... argument is optional; if not specified, qcomicbook will be installed in
/usr/local directory).

If you want to compile qcomicbook with e.g. /usr prefix, but install it to a temporary
location for packaging, then pass DESTDIR variable to 'make install', e.g.
$ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/package_root

4. Known issues
---------------
* rar/unrar (and unzip/unace probably too) may have problems with files/dirs in the
archive, which names contain non-ascii characters (like special characters for you
language). As a result they won't be decompressed and qcomicbook may show
"No images found" error box.
* the free (opensource) unrar doesn't currently support 3.0 rar archives. Such archives are reported
as empty by QComicBook. It is *recommended* to use non-free rar/unrar.
