1. Introduction
---------------
QComicBook is a viewer for comic book archives containing
jpeg/png/xpm/gif images, which aims at convenience and simplicity.
Features include: automatic decompression, full-screen mode, two-pages
viewing, japanese mode, thumbnails view, page scaling, mouse or keyboard
navigation etc.

2. Requirements
---------------
QComicBook requires Qt library version >=3.3.3. It *may* work with earlier
versions (from 3.x family), but it was not tested. You will also need
unzip, rar (or unrar), unace and tar (with gzip and bzip2 support compiled in)
somewhere in your path to handle archives. If one of these tools is missing
you can still use QComicBook, but you won't be able to open some archives.

3. Installation
---------------
To compile QComicBook, you will need Qt developement package (Qt
headers, usually named -devel- in many distros). Compilation include
three steps:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install

Debian users should add "--with-Qt-lib-dir=/usr/lib" option to the
first step. NOTE: Debian/Ubuntu users may compile this package using Debian
methods -- see Debian guides for details.

4. Known issues
---------------
rar/unrar (and unzip/unace probably too) may have problems with files/dirs in the
archive, which names contain non-ascii characters (like special characters for you
language). As a result they won't be decompressed and qcomicbook may show
"No images found" error box.

5. Bugs
-------
Please report any bugs to: yogin@linux.bydg.org. Ideas are welcome too!
