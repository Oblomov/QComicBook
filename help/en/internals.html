<h1>Internals</h1>
<p>
Here is some information for people interested in QComicBook internals.

<h2>Settings handling</h2>
QComicBook keeps settings in ~/.qcomicbook directory within these two files:
<ul>
	<li>qcomicbookrc - main configuration file
	<li>bookmarks - bookmarks file
</ul>
Both files are plain text files and may be edited manually (with caution!), if needed.
</p>

<h2>Thumbnails handling</h2>
Thumbnails are stored (if thumbnails disk caching is enabled) in ~/.qcomicbook/cache
directory.

<h2>Archives handling</h2>
Archived comic books are decompressed to temporary directory
(/tmp/qcomicbook-XXXXX, with XXXXX being some random number). This directory is
purged when closing current comic book, opening a new one or quitting
QComicBook.
