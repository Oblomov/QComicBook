<h2><a name="file">File</a></h2>
<p>
<b>File</b> menu provies basic operations for loading comic books:
<ul>
	<li>Open directory - open directory containg images
	<li>Open archive - open archived images
	<li>Recently opened - list of ten recently opened archives / directories (most
	    recently opened on the top)
	<li>Info - displays information about currenly opened comic book. This includes
	contents of file_id.diz *.nfo files (if any) as well as memory usage info
	<li>Settings - allows you to <a href="#settings">fine-tune some options</a>
	<li>Close - closes currently opened comic book
	<li>Quit - quits QComicBook
</ul>
</p>
<p>
QComicBook offers some tunable options, available via <a name="settings"><b>Settings</b></a>
menu option. These options include:
<ul>
	<li>Background color - the color of the empty area around displayed image
	<li>Hide menubar in fullscreen mode - menubar may be hidded in fullscreen mode if desired; together with
	<a href="#view">toolbar hiding option</a>, it may give you the whole screen for displaying page contents.
	<li>Hide statusbar in fullscreen mode - statusbar may be hidden in fullscreen mode, giving you even more space
	<li>Small mouse cursor - toggles small (4x4 pixels) mouse cursor for QComicBook window
	<li>Scaling method - the algorithm used for image scaling; either <i>Smooth</i> or
	    <i>Fast</i>. Smooth scaling provides best quality, but is slower; it is recommened method
	    unless you have really slow machine.
	<li>Info text font - font used for Info dialog.
	 <li>Cache size - the number of pages kept in memory. Value of 0 disables caching; 1 has no effect
	    on performance; 2 or more may improve your experience. Keep in mind, that caching may consume a lot
	    of memory - for example, an 1280x1984 image may take as much as 9Mb of memory!
    	 <li>Preload next page - enables page preloading in the background. This setting takes effect only for
	 cache size of 3 and greater. It is recommended to enable this option, as it may really improve overall
	 experience.
	 <li>Use disk cache for thumbnails - thumbnails are saved to disk, which speeds up things when loading them
	 later. Set this option on if you tend to open comic books more then once.
	 <li>Number of days to keep thumbnails - defines, for how long to keep thumbnails on disk; old thumbnails are
	 deleted when exiting QComicBook. Value of 0 disables purging.
	 <li>Help browser - allows to choose between simple built-in browser (the default) or any other external web browser.
	 <li>Forward and backward two pages in two-pages mode
	 <li>Open info dialog after opening comic book - when enabled, info dialog is opened after opening comic
	 book. You may still open this dialog manually with File/Info menu option.
	 <li>Confirm exit
 </ul>
Note: changing cache size takes effect on new comic book.
</p>

<h2><a name="view">View</a></h2>

	<li>Fit height - image is scaled to fit window height
	<li>Whole page - image is scaled to fit window
	<li>Best fit - depending on image dimensions, QComicBook chooses the best method
	to scale image
</ul>
The page can be rotated with 90 degree step, with these options:
<ul>
	<li>Rotate right - rotates image clockwise
	<li>Rotate left - rotates image counter clockwise

<h2><a name="bookmarks">Bookmarks</a></h2>
<p>
<b>Bookmarks</b> menu allows you to bookmark pages in comic books.
These bookmarks are however somewhat different than, for example, in any
webbrowser and are more similiar to real bookmarks. Each bookmark keeps
bookmarked page number (as well as file name), so you can easily start with
your comic book from the point, where you last stopped reading.
</p>
Two options are available in this menu:
<ul>
	<li>Set bookmark for this comicbook - creates bookmark for current
	  comic book; existing bookmark for this comic book is deleted
	<li>Remove bookmark for this comicbook - removes existing bookmark
	for current comic book; to remove other bookmarks, use <i>Manage bookmarks</i> option.
	<li>Manage bookmarks - opens bookmark manager, where bookmarks can be
	easily removed.
</ul>
<p>
Below these options you can see the list of currently saved bookmarks. Just
click on one of them to go to bookmarked comic book and page.
